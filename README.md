# ProfAI â€” Frontend scaffold

This scaffold contains the core frontend components for the ProfAI MVP: LessonList, LessonViewer, Playground, Quiz, and TeacherDashboard. Utilities include a mock grader, basic hinting, and sentiment analysis used for adaptive feedback.\

Next steps:
1. Wire API calls to the backend `/lessons` and `/submissions` endpoints.
2. Replace the frontend grader with backend sandboxed grading.
3. Add authentication and teacher analytics.
4. Improve styling and accessibility.
